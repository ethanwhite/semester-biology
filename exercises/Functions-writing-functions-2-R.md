1. Copy the following function (which converts weights in pounds to weights in grams and rounds them) into your assignment. Replace the `________` with the variables names for the input and output. Replace `__` with a number so that by default the function will round the output to one decimal place.

```r
convert_pounds_to_grams <- function(________, numdigits = __) {
    grams = 453.6 * pounds
    rounded = round(grams, digits = numdigits)
    return(________)
}
```

Use the function to calculate how many grams there are in 3.75 pounds using the default for the number of decimal places.

2. Write a function called `get_height_from_weight` that takes three arguments, `weight`, `a`, and `b`, and returns and estimate of `height` using `height = a * weight ^ b` (a prediction from a power model). Give it default arguments of `a` = 12 and `b` = 0.38. There should be no default value for `weight`. Use the default argument values (by passing only the value of `weight` to the function) to calculate `height` when `weight` = 42.

3. The function in (2) assumes that the weight is provided in grams. Use the functions from (1) and (2) in combination to estimate the height for an animal that weighs 1 pound.
